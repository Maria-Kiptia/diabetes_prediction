# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning  
## Overview  
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on medical and lifestyle data. The dataset is processed, visualized, and used to train a logistic regression model.  

## Features  
âœ… **Data Exploration** â€“ Initial analysis to understand patterns and distributions.  
âœ… **Visualization** â€“ Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful plots (histograms, box plots, correlation heatmaps).  
âœ… **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical features.  
âœ… **Model Training** â€“ Logistic regression implementation using Scikit-learn.  
âœ… **Evaluation** â€“ Assessing model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## Technologies Used  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Flask/Streamlit
