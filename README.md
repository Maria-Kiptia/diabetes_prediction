# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning  
## Overview  
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on medical and lifestyle data. The dataset is processed, visualized, and used to train a logistic regression model.  

## Features  
✅ **Data Exploration** – Initial analysis to understand patterns and distributions.  
✅ **Visualization** – Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful plots (histograms, box plots, correlation heatmaps).  
✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical features.  
✅ **Model Training** – Logistic regression implementation using Scikit-learn.  
✅ **Evaluation** – Assessing model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
✅ **Deployment** – Guidelines for deploying the model using Flask or Streamlit.  

## Technologies Used  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Flask/Streamlit  

## Installation  
1️⃣ Clone the repository → `git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git && cd diabetes-prediction`  
2️⃣ Install dependencies → `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook → `jupyter notebook`  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project can be found **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset)**.  

## Results  
✔ **Accuracy:** ~96%  
✔ **High precision but lower recall for diabetic cases** → needs improvement in detecting diabetes.
